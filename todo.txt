1. Write a program to demonstrate FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based
on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

2. Write a program for Candidate Elimination algorithm for finding the consistent version space
based on a given set of training data samples. The training data is read from a .CSV file.

3. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test
the same using appropriate data sets.

4. Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored
as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.

5. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian Classifier model
to perform this task. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.

6. Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to
demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set.

7. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for
clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on
the quality of clustering.

8. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print
both correct and wrong predictions.

9. Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points.
Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.

10. Write a program to predict high risk patients based on variables (e.g. blood pressure, age etc.) and
discriminate them from low risk patients.

11. Develop a genetic algorithm for optimization of hyper parameters in machine learning.
